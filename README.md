# Dino-Dash
This is a group project I participated in for a side-scrolling platformer named "Dino Dash". Created using Pycharm in the Python language.
Controls: WASD keys for character movement. Y or N keys to start or exit the game.
Objective: Avoid the creates to beat your high score!
Miscellaneous: The game progressively speeds up as you keep going. Score is measured in seconds as your Dino runs.
